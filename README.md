# TSS Action Segmentation
Transferable subspace segmentation (TSS) is a novel approach for human action segmentation in time space. It utilizes well labeled source video to improve the target video segmentation performance.

## Running the code
The code is MATLAB code works in Ubuntu system. Windows system may need minor revision in the folder name. Direct diwnload the code and run TSS_main.m.
